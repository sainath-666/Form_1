## Technologies Used

- **CSS**: For styling, including responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity (e.g., smooth scrolling, navigation toggle, slider interactivity, and thank-you animation).
- **Optional**:
  - **Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS**: Used to expedite styling and ensure responsiveness across different devices.
  - **React.js/Angular/Vue.js**: If dynamic elements are implemented (optional as per the requirements).
